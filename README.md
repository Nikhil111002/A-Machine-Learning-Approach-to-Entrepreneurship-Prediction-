# 🧠 A Machine Learning Approach to Entrepreneurship Prediction

This project focuses on predicting entrepreneurial potential using survey data sourced from Kaggle. It leverages machine learning models—specifically **Logistic Regression** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**—to classify whether an individual is likely to become an entrepreneur based on demographic, socio-economic, and personality traits.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: Kaggle  
- Includes features like: age, education, experience, income level, personality traits, etc.  
- Target variable: **Entrepreneur** (Yes/No)

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Explore and understand the factors influencing entrepreneurship.
- Preprocess and visualize the dataset.
- Train and evaluate classification models (Logistic Regression & SVM).

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas & NumPy (Data Handling)
- Seaborn & Matplotlib (Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Modeling & Evaluation)

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and converted categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualized key trends and correlations.
3. **Model Building**: Applied Logistic Regression and SVM.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.
